Worked with Pacman with only minor changes:

In pacman federateddeployment, change:

MONGO_SERVICE_HOST to match monto service endpoints: SEE BELOW
MONGO_PORT back to default mongo tcp/ip port of 27017
MONGO_USE_SSL to false


Had to change hostnames to match internal endpoints, but with namespace added,

Looks like: service.namespace e.g.

    mongo-svc-a.sku-mongo,mongo-svc-b.sku-mongo,mongo-svc-c.sku-mongo

After changing pacman's endpoints, found pacman still got unnamespaced hosts
out of the MongoDB replicaset, so had to change those hostnames too:

Useful info on changing RS in flight:

Finally, I had to create a user (inky:clyde) and a database (pacman) for access to work appropriately:

I found simple instructions here: https://zocada.com/setting-mongodb-users-beginners-guide/

    use pacman
    db.createUser(
      {
        user: "inky",
        pwd: "clyde",
        roles: [ { role: "readWrite", db: "pacman" } ]
      }
    )
